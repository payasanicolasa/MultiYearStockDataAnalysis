**Multiple Year Stock Data Analysis**

*Project Description:*
This is an Excel VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

>Data consolidated by each ticker symbol
>Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
>The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
>The total stock volume of the stock.
>The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

*Challenges*
Because this is my first attempt at using VBA, I came across several challenges, including (but not limited to) failing to close loops and ElseIfs, and ensuring the cell references are correctly placing data in the new columns.

*To Use*
Import the script into Microsoft Excel for best results.
